xv6 memory paging


This project is part of an Operating Systems course taken in BGU. We introduce a 2-level paging mechanism. There are 4 paging policies: NONE, FIFO, SCFIFO and NFU.
These policies are invoked with the SELECTION flag when launching, i.e.

$ make clean qemu SELECTION=FIFO

If the flag isn't defined at launch, then NFU is used.

There are three places where the level of printing can be decided for the tests (in addition to the flag VERBOSE_PRINT) by setting the DEBUG constant to either a zero or a non-zero value.
The default for all three is zero, which means minimal printing. Setting a non-zero variable would enable verbose printing.
The options are as follows:

1. proc.c - would print out info about the pages that are in memory.
2. myMemTest.c - would perform more memory I-O and print accordingly.
3. vm.c - would print out the chosen pages to be paged out by the current policy.

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6.html, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run "make".
On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you will
need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing x86 ELF
binaries.  See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/tools.html.
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-".

To run xv6, install the QEMU PC simulators.  To run in QEMU, run "make qemu".

To create a typeset version of the code, run "make xv6.pdf".  This
requires the "mpage" utility.  See http://www.mesa.nl/pub/mpage/.
